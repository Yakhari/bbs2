                <h4>
                    Sorting your Pokémon in the mobile version of Pokémon HOME is about to become easier than ever with June's update. <br>
                    The Catch Calendar feature allows you to view your Pokémon arranged by the dates on which you caught them. <br>
                    This will let you relive memories from your adventures, such as the day you caught your very first Pokémon <br>
                    or the day you finally added a powerful Legendary Pokémon to your team. You can also set specific dates as Anniversaries, <br>
                    such as your birthday or the day you first met a Pokémon that has become special to you.<br>
                    <br>
                    The updated Pokédex introduces the ability to view Pokémon registered to your Pokémon HOME Pokédex from different angles. <br>
                    You'll be able to get a better look at your Pokémon partners, and you might even discover some new details that you didn't notice before.<br>
                    To top things off, these new features are being commemorated with special Bulbasaur and Squirtle <br>
                    that you'll be able to receive as Mystery Gifts in both the mobile version of Pokémon HOME and in your Pokémon Sword or Pokémon Shield game. <br>
                    What makes these two beloved Pokémon so remarkable is that they carry the Gigantamax Factor!<br>
